# IPL Data Analysis – Sports Data Science Project

This repository contains an end-to-end data science pipeline analysing Indian Premier League (IPL) match and player data to uncover performance trends, derive insights, and visualise key metrics.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and transformation of raw IPL match datasets.  
- Exploratory analysis and visualization to uncover player performance trends, team success factors, and season-wise patterns.  
- A lightweight interactive dashboard (optional) for exploring team vs. player comparisons, run aggregates and win probabilities.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Workflow
| Stage             | Tool / Library                 | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Data ingestion   | Python, Pandas                | Load raw CSV / JSON match & player data      |
| Data cleaning    | Pandas, NumPy                 | Handle missing values, format dates, filter  |
| Feature engineering | Pandas, custom functions     | Compute metrics (e.g., strike rate, run rate)|
| Analysis & viz   | Matplotlib, Seaborn           | Generate graphs: season-wise, player vs team|
| Dashboard (optional) | Plotly / Streamlit          | Provide interactive data exploration         |

### Workflow overview:
1. Load and clean raw data (match results, player stats, season info).  
2. Engineer metrics such as runs per over, strike rate, win-loss percentages.  
3. Perform statistical analysis: correlations, distributions, trend lines.  
4. Visualise results through charts and dashboards to highlight insights.  
5. (Optionally) Export or share findings in a report or interactive web view.
